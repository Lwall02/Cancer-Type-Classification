# üß¨ Cancer Type Classification Using LASSO Regularization

This project applies multinomial logistic regression with LASSO regularization to classify cancer patients into three distinct subtypes using gene expression data. The work is based on our submission to a public Kaggle Cancer Type Classification Competition, where our model achieved a perfect score of 1.000 (3rd place out of 26 competeing models).

#### üéØ Research Objective

To accurately classify patients into one of three cancer subtypes using high-dimensional gene expression data:

- **Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)**
- **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC)**
- **Ovarian Cancer (OV)**

Accurate subtype classification can improve early detection, inform treatment plans, and enhance our understanding of cancer genetics.

#### üìä Model Description

The model framework employs Multinomial Logistic Regression with LASSO regularization, implemented via the R package `glmnet`.

The underlying model is:

- **Model Type:** Multinomial Logistic Regression
- **Regularization:** LASSO (L1) penalty for feature selection
- **Optimization:** 10-fold cross-validation using `cv.glmnet`
- **Data Dimensions:**
   - 12,043 features (gene expression levels)
   - 886 training patients (GBM = 376, LUSC = 90, OV = 420)
   - 379 testing patients

The LASSO penalty enforces sparsity by shrinking irrelevant gene coefficients to zero, identifying a smaller subset of genes with predictive importance.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Data Processing

- **Source:** The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) via Kaggle
- **Platform:** Affymetrix HT Human Genome U133a microarray
- **Transformation:** All gene expression values were log-transformed prior to modeling for variance stabilization.
- **Cleaning:** Ensured valid feature names, removed inconsistencies, and encoded cancer types as categorical factors.

#### üß† Model Training & Validation

Cross-validation was used to tune the regularization parameter Œª, balancing bias and variance:

- Cross-validation: 10-fold CV on training data
- Best Œª: ‚âà 0.00487
- Packages Used: `glmnet`, `tidyverse`, `janitor`, `arrow`, `coefplot`
- Evaluation Metric: Misclassification error

All model training was conducted in R 4.3 using reproducible scripts included in the `scripts/` directory.

#### üîç Key Takeaways

- LASSO effectively reduced over 12,000 features to a smaller interpretable subset of genes.
- Perfect test accuracy demonstrates strong discriminative power between GBM, LUSC, and OV subtypes.
- The workflow demonstrates the power of regularized regression for high-dimensional biomedical data.
- This approach may inform future research into gene-level biomarkers for early cancer detection.
